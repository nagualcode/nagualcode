  Orchestrating tech and music at [Moods](https://moods.com.br/), where I blend **IoT**, **cloud systems**, and custom visual and soundscapes for retail 🎛️☁️🎧.  

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning**:  
  Diving deep into **genomics, proteomics**, and **bioinformatics** 🧬🔬—because understanding life's code is just as fascinating as writing computer code! On the tech side, I’m also expanding my skills in **AI**, **automation**, and **cloud computing** 🤖☁️.  

- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**:  
  Creative projects at the intersection of **tech and biology**, **sound design**, **data science**, and **AI**. If you’re into bioinformatics or music tech, let’s chat! 🎹📊🧬  

- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with**:  
  Connecting the dots between **biology and technology**—whether it’s building pipelines for **genomic data analysis** or creating new ways to automate sound systems 🎶⚙️.

- 💬 **Ask me about**:  
  🎵 Sound design  
  🧬 Genomics and bioinformatics  
  💻 Cloud-based solutions
